# Palindrome Partitioning II

## Overview
"Palindrome Partitioning II" is a Python implementation of an algorithm to determine the minimum number of cuts needed to partition a string into substrings, each of which is a palindrome. This problem is an interesting and more challenging variant of the classic palindrome partitioning problem and involves dynamic programming for an efficient solution.

## Problem Statement
Given a string, the task is to divide it into the minimum number of substrings such that each substring is a palindrome. The algorithm finds the optimal number of such cuts.

## Implementation
The solution involves two key steps:
1. Pre-computing a table to check if any substring is a palindrome.
2. Using dynamic programming to determine the minimum number of cuts for each substring.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because we need to check every possible substring to determine if it is a palindrome and then compute the minimum cuts.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for storing the palindrome check information and O(n) for storing the minimum cut information.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
